gphys 0.7-2
===========
* Allow subset.spiketimes to use even duplicated channels but warn that only
  the first sweep will be used in this case.

gphys 0.7-1
===========
* Allow subset.spiketimes to use channels even when some (other) channels are
  duplicated in odd config.

gphys 0.7
===========
* Fix bug in OdourResponseFromSpikes() when counting spikes from a merged 
  spiketimes object in which the block fewer trials was merged with a block
  with more trials. Resulted in sweeps for the two blocks being mismatched
  / misordered.

gphys 0.6-7
===========
* Make baselineWindow=NULL the default in OdourResponseFromSpikes() so that it is
  easier for wrapper functions to switch between specifying a baseline window
  or not having one.

gphys 0.6-6
===========
* Give smooth_decimate an extend option (that is passed on to stats::filter)
  to allow padding of data to end.
* Give smooth_decimate frequency and deltat options that can be used instead of
  downsamplefactor. Again passed to stats::filter.

gphys 0.6-5
===========
* Give smooth_decimate a sides option (that is passed on to stats::filter)
* Return call in smooth_decimate result
* Better example for smooth_decimate (that is actually run)

gphys 0.6-4
===========
* Allow multiple stimulus bars on raster plots
  Specified as c(start1,stop1,start2,stop2)
* Fix bug in plotting stimulus bar 
  (extended outside y axis; usually invisible but obvious in svg format)

gphys 0.6-3
===========
* AddLinesToRasterPlot can now cope with multiple colours
* PlotRastersFromSweeps can be told not to plot spikes or dividing lines 
  so that it can be used to set up an empty plot to which AddLinesToRasterPlot
  can then add lines. See ?AddLinesToRasterPlot for examples.
* new plot.spiketimes function allows plot() to be called directly on a 
  spiketimes object.

gphys 0.6-2
===========
* split.spiketimes now gives each new block a name of form <pxpnum>.<repeatnum>
  So if experiment 008 contains 4 repeats we will get:
  c("008.000","008.001","008.002","008.003")
* merge.spiketimes now gives each merged block a name of form <pxpnuma>,<pxpnumb>
  So if we merge experiments 001,002,003 with experiments 004,005 we'll get
  c("001,004","002,005","003,")
* OdourResponseFromSpikes can now cope with spiketimes lists that do not have
  names (this is defensive since splitting and merging produce sensible names).

gphys 0.6-1
===========
* merge.spiketimes can merge lists with different numbers of repeats
* OdourResponseFromSpikes can cope with missing sweeps (they come back as NA)
  and it will always convert sweeps that have no spikes to count 0.

gphys 0.6
=========
* add smpsth function to generate smooth peristimulus time histogram using STAR
  psth function from gphys spiketimes objects. Note that these will fail when 
  any sweep has no spikes.
* add mpsth class to handle lists of multiple STAR psth objects
  (e.g. for different odours or for different neurons)

gphys 0.5-4
===========
* Several small changes to PlotRasterFromSweeps
  - with pch='rect' (ie spikes as rectangles rather than dots) then 
    spikeheight option sets the relative spike height and defaults to much
    prettier looking value of 0.8 than its previous implicit value of 1.
  - new frame.plot option in PlotRasterFromSweeps to control whether a box
    surrounds the plot
  - xaxs and yaxs options to control whether the x and y axes are expanded.
    the default is now to use exactly the specified xlim and ylim (which is
    not R's default behaviour)
* teach subset.spiketimes to cope with ODD configs that have repeated odour
  names (but note that you still can't subset any of these repeated odours 
  by name, only by channel number)
* Option to convert NAs to 0 in OdourResponseFromSpikes (default TRUE)
* export is.spiketimes function

gphys 0.5-3
===========
* fix bug in visibility of "[.spiketimes" which was causing problems
  for Aaron's mergeSpiketrain function (because subsetting a spiketrains
  object produced a plain list rather than a new spiketimes object).
* Option to plot spikes with rectangles of specified width in 
  PlotRasterFromSweeps

gphys 0.5-2
===========
* some documentation improvements
  (PlotOdourResponseFromSpikes,[.spiketimes,finder_colour)

gphys 0.5-1
===========
* merge.spiketimes function for spiketimes objects with different odd configs
  (limited to case where there are the same number of trials for each odour).
* implemented proper subsetting of spiketimes object 
  ie spiketimesobj[1:3] now behaves properly
* +.spiketimes checks compatibility between spiketimes objects more carefully
* finder_colour_fast is much faster for long lists of files [ao]
* documentation fixes

gphys 0.5
=========
* Add functions for handling timeseries data (ie voltages rather than spikes)
  including: scale.ts, mean.mts, smooth_decimate, tsp.nclamppxp
  and a new plot function AddLinesToRasterPlot.
* IgorR package (on CRAN) is now a dependency (instead of a suggestion).

gphys 0.4-1
=========
* Option not to plot x and y axes in PlotRasterFromSweeps

gphys 0.4
=========
* CollectSpikesFromSweeps/PlotRasterFromSweeps can now read/plot subsets of
  spkes defined by odour name or channel number.
* This depends on a new function subset.spiketimes.
* STAR package is now a dependency (which must be installed from CRAN).
* New as.repeatedTrain function will convert gphys spiketimes objects to STAR
  repeatedTrain objects, allowing STAR's psth function to be used.
* New fix.odd function to handle situation where ODD has been miswired
* Significant documentation improvements (including package docs ?gphys) 
gphys 0.3-2
=========
* You can now set options(gphys.datadir='/path/to/my/data') so that you can
  specify relative paths in CollectSpikesFromSweeps/PlotRasterFromSweeps,
  ideally just the Igor cell name.

gphys 0.3-1
=========
* New OdourResponseFromSpikes function that can be used to extract the number or
  frequency of spikes in a window (optionally subtracting a baseline).
* PlotRasterFromSweeps plots left hand edge of box when the axis starts at time>0 

gphys 0.3
=========
* Teach CollectSpikesFromSweeps/PlotRasterFromSweeps to use Jonny's spike subdirs
* Make sure that CollectSpikesFromSweeps/PlotRasterFromSweeps only reads ODD files
  that match the sweeps that have been selected.
* ?gphys shows package help
* utility functions to set and query Finder colour labels

gphys 0.2-1
=========
* plot odour stimulus as an opaque rectangle behind spike rasters rather than
  a semi-transparent one in front.

gphys 0.2
=========
* handle experiments with repeated identical blocks (using split.spiketimes)
* can now specify stimRange when collecting sweeps
* can now specify xlim when collecting sweeps
* and PlotRasterFromSweeps will use this info for plotting
* +.spiketimes allows multiple consistent spiketimes objects to be gathered together  

gphys 0.1
=========
* First version

gphys 0.4-1
=========
* Option not to plot x and y axes in PlotRasterFromSweeps

gphys 0.4
=========
* CollectSpikesFromSweeps/PlotRasterFromSweeps can now read/plot subsets of
  spkes defined by odour name or channel number.
* This depends on a new function subset.spiketimes.
* STAR package is now a dependency (which must be installed from CRAN).
* New as.repeatedTrain function will convert gphys spiketimes objects to STAR
  repeatedTrain objects, allowing STAR's psth function to be used.
* New fix.odd function to handle situation where ODD has been miswired
* Significant documentation improvements (including package docs ?gphys) 
gphys 0.3-2
=========
* You can now set options(gphys.datadir='/path/to/my/data') so that you can
  specify relative paths in CollectSpikesFromSweeps/PlotRasterFromSweeps,
  ideally just the Igor cell name.

gphys 0.3-1
=========
* New OdourResponseFromSpikes function that can be used to extract the number or
  frequency of spikes in a window (optionally subtracting a baseline).
* PlotRasterFromSweeps plots left hand edge of box when the axis starts at time>0 

gphys 0.3
=========
* Teach CollectSpikesFromSweeps/PlotRasterFromSweeps to use Jonny's spike subdirs
* Make sure that CollectSpikesFromSweeps/PlotRasterFromSweeps only reads ODD files
  that match the sweeps that have been selected.
* ?gphys shows package help
* utility functions to set and query Finder colour labels

gphys 0.2-1
=========
* plot odour stimulus as an opaque rectangle behind spike rasters rather than
  a semi-transparent one in front.

gphys 0.2
=========
* handle experiments with repeated identical blocks (using split.spiketimes)
* can now specify stimRange when collecting sweeps
* can now specify xlim when collecting sweeps
* and PlotRasterFromSweeps will use this info for plotting
* +.spiketimes allows multiple consistent spiketimes objects to be gathered together  

gphys 0.1
=========
* First version

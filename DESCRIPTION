Description: Provides functions to make spike time raster plots for
    electrophysiological data acquired and pre-analysed by the 'Neuromatic'
    package for 'Igor Pro'. The input data format is a simple text file saved
    by 'Igor Pro' and could no doubt be generated by other spike sorting
    packages. Additional functionality includes counting spikes in response
    bins, baseline substraction, making (smoothed) peri-stimulus time
    histograms and a lifetime sparseness measure. There is also a bridge class
    which enables data to be used with the sophisticated analysis tools in the
    'STAR' package.
